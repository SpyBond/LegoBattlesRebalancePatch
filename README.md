This patch file for the Nintendo DS videogame Lego Battles allows you to apply balance changes to the game that makes it for fun to play both in multiplayer and in singleplayer. 

This is only a patch file and does not include the rest of the game. You must use [Crystal Tile 2](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/818/) or a similar ROM packing tool with a legally obtained ROM of Lego Battles to apply the patch to the game. Further instructions on how to do this will be given below.  

Note that while this patch is fully playable in singleplayer, all players in multiplayer must be using this patch in order for the game to function properly.

## Philosophy
The intent of this patch is to change the statistics of various characters and vehicles in Lego Battles in order to allow every unit to be viable within a multiplayer setting. In order to accomplish this, one unit from each category has been chosen to serve as controls, that is to say that their statistics will not be changed. Every other unit's statistics will be either increased or decreased to meet the standard set by the control units. Additionally, this patch intends to make every unit feel distinct from one eachother, and avoid certian units having strictly worse statistics than another unit. Overall, this patch should cause the multiplayer expierence of the game to be more varied, unpredictable, and overall more enjoyable.
